A collection of papers related to Biometric Gait Recognition.

#Gait
Gait - the pattern of movement of the limbs of humans, during locomotion over a solid substrate.

Minor variations in gait style can be used as a biometric identifier to identify individual people.
These biometric identifiers are commonly used for reducing fraud, increasing physical safety and improving convenience.

#Papers
Gait recognition using accelerometer data has been studied as far back as 2006, but recent developments in Machine Learning and the readily available inertial sensors in mobile devices sparked new research in the field recently.

####Here is a collection of academic papers attempting to recognize a subject thru Gait.
